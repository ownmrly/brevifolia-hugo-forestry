## I'm an Independent graphic designer with interests of expanding my skills, and learning more about cultural design and design for social good.

I always had a drive for digital design which lead me to become a graphic designer. A graduate from Humber College, I was honoured to start my career working at the Canadian Premier League during their historical inaugural season. Now I am looking for new opportunities and make my own pathway of success.

#### I am also currently open for freelance projects. If interested, contact me.
